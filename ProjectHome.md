This project consists of two main components:

-an Android client application for recording audio

-a server based on opensource Julius ASR engine to recognize voice commands


The main purpose of the project is to create a voice interface that allows users to initiate scripts and commands on a server by speaking commands into their Android phone.


Applications can range from simple command'n'control within the operating system (eg. changing tracks on a music player) to controlling external hardware (eg. turning lights on or off using something like Arduino).


The project is mostly "proof of concept" and doesn't implement many commands. It's simple design should allow anyone with moderate scripting skills to realize their ideas.
