To properly use this program you first need to download and install several components.

# Required components #

  * [client application](Client.md) installed on the phone
  * [server application](Server.md) installed on a computer
  * [Julius](Julius.md) ASR engine
  * [acoutsic models](AcousticModels.md)

# Configuration and usage #

After you have installed all these programs, you need to configure the server to make it work. This process is two-fold:

  1. You need to define what the system will recognize by compiling and activating [grammars](grammars.md).
  1. You need to define how the system will react to recognized commands by writing appropriate [scripts](scripts.md).
